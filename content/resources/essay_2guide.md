description: In this file students are asked to read carefully the two (or three)
  argument-driven articles, read one or two background articles from news sources
  then to take notes that focus on the key arguments and  assumptions that is what
  are the writer?s priorities? what aspects of the controversy does the writer overlook
  or shy away from?  are there gaps or inconsistencies in the writer?s argument?what
  insight have you derived from your reading that might intrigue or enlighten your
  readers? what would you like your readers to think about?while you will inevitably
  "compare and contrast" the articles to arrive at their insight, the essay that students
  are expected to write is not a "compare and contrast" essay.
